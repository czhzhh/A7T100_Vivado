TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock Ece253_BlockDesign_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_pll_i and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock Ece253_BlockDesign_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin Ece253_BlockDesign_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '15' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

XDCC-2#1 Warning
Scoped Non-Timing constraint/property overwritten  
A new XDC property IOSTANDARD on clock_rtl overrides a previous scoped property. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) property and could result in unexpected behaviours.
